Hi! Currently am a student at UC Berkeley studying for a Computer Science & Math double. I'm primarily interested in machine learning, but I enjoy any sort of tricky problems, so feel free to reach out to share any cool questions or talking points about ML! Below you can also find a couple of my projects and papers:

## Projects
Most of my projects can be found on my Github, but will be moving here soon! :)

## Papers
A collection of expository/research papers I wrote back in high school. They focus on topics in theoretical math and aim to explain them in a way high school me was able to understand.
- [Sums of Two Squares in Different Rings](Sums_of_Two_Squares_in_Different_Rings.pdf)
    - The paper explores what numbers in $$\mathbb Z[\sqrt n]$$ are representable as the sum of two squares (in that ring as well), a topic I came up with by generalizing a homework problem. I had initially wanted to expand it to the Eisenstein integers but was not able to find a concrete representation, but am nonethless pretty satisfied with this research paper.
- [Generalizations on Bertrand's Postulate](Generalizations_on_Bertrand_s_Postulate.pdf)
    - This is an expository paper following an article detailing Ramanujan's proof of Bertrand's Postulate, which additionally gives nice generalizations when there are at least $$k$$ primes between $$n$$ and $$2n$$.
- [Intro to Knot Theory](A_Basic_Introduction_on_Knot_Theory.pdf)
    - This is an expository paper written as my project for SUMaC 2019, and goes into knot invariants while discussion different classifications of knots. 
- [RSA with Mutant Prime Knots](RSA_with_Mutant_Prime_Knots.pdf)
    - An expository paper about how prime knots, just like the cyclic groups, can be used for RSA through their Dowker-Thistlethwaite sequences.
- [The j-Invariant](Introduction_of_the_j_Function.pdf)
    - Expository paper on complex analysis and modular theory talking about the $$j$$-invariant, an invariant for elliptic curves. The paper also introduces a lot of representation theory and modular functions for additional background.
- [Intro to Class Groups](Class_Groups.pdf)
    - Expository paper on class groups and numbers, which tell us when the integers over an arbitrary algebraic field can be uniquely decomposed (or prime factorized). We do this by developing fundamental abstract algebra concepts and then introducing Minkowski's Theorem.
- [Random Walks in Groups](Random_Walks_in_Groups.pdf)
    - Expository paper on the mixing times of random walks, defined as the amount of time it takes for a Markov chain to be sufficiently "randomized" or close to its stationary distribution. I was a part of a research group that expanded upon this question, and you can find my notes below.
- [Nevanlinna Pick Interpolation](Nevanlinna_Pick_Interpolation.pdf)
    - An expository paper that introduces complex analysis to solve the question of whether we can extend Lagrange interpolation to the complex unit disk.
- [Research Notes on Mixing Times](Mixing_Times_Research___Kevin.pdf)
    - Research notes when I was in a research group on finding the optimal generators to minimize/maximize the mixing time of a random walk on a circle. The generators determined the available moves at every step, for example 2 being 2 steps forward and -1 being 1 step back. I managed to get solutions to the 2-generator case, but they optimized the spectral gap, which although is very closely interlinked with the mixing time is not exactly the same. After attending university I have left this project on pause, but will return to it in the future.
