Hi! Currently am a student at UC Berkeley studying for a Computer Science & Math double. I'm primarily interested in machine learning, but I enjoy any sort of tricky problems, so feel free to reach out to share any cool questions or talking points about ML! Below you can also find a couple of my projects and papers:

# Projects
Most of my projects can be found on my Github, but will be moving here soon! :)

# Papers
A collection of expository papers I wrote back in high school. They focus on topics in theoretical math and aim to explain them in a way high school me was able to understand.
- [Sums of Two Squares in Different Rings]()
