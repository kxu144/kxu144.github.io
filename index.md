Hi! Currently am a student at UC Berkeley studying for a Computer Science & Math double. I'm primarily interested in machine learning, but I enjoy any sort of tricky problems, so feel free to reach out to share any cool questions or talking points about ML! Below you can also find a couple of my projects and papers:

## Projects
Most of my projects can be found on my Github, but will be moving here soon! :)

## Papers
A collection of expository/research papers I wrote back in high school. They focus on topics in theoretical math and aim to explain them in a way high school me was able to understand.
- [Sums of Two Squares in Different Rings](Sums_of_Two_Squares_in_Different_Rings.pdf)
* The paper explores what numbers in $\mathbb Z[\sqrt n]$ are representable as the sum of two squares (in that ring as well). I had initially wanted to expand it to the Eisenstein integers but was not able to find a concrete representation, but am nonethless pretty satisfied with this research paper.
- [Generalizations on Bertrand's Postulate](Generalizations_on_Bertrand_s_Postulate.pdf)
* This is an expository paper following an article detailing Ramanujan's proof of Bertrand's Postulate, which additionally gives nice generalizations when there are at least $k$ primes between $n$ and $2n$.
- [Intro to Knot Theory](A_Basic_Introduction_on_Knot_Theory.pdf)
* This is an expository paper written as my project for SUMaC 2019, and goes into knot invariants while discussion different classifications of knots. 
- [RSA with Mutant Prime Knots](RSA_with_Mutant_Prime_Knots.pdf)
* An expository paper about how prime knots, just like the cyclic groups, can be used for RSA through their Dowker-Thistlethwaite sequences.
