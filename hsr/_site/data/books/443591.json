   "localDesc": "Trailblazer, March, Dan Heng:<br /><br />By the time you read this letter, I should have returned to the Overworld and be on my way to see my mother. I apologize for not telling you of my plan.\u00a0I was afraid that\u00a0you would strongly object, which might sway my resolve.<br /><br />Madam Cocolia raised me up, and I will never be able to repay her kindness. She taught me countless\u00a0life lessons and virtues, as well as how to defend Belobog and its people. Even though she has lately\u00a0made certain decisions that puzzled me, I can't let go of all the precious memories I have with her. I must communicate my point of view and thoughts to her honestly, and seek to arrive at a mutual understanding with her \u2014 this is my goal as a daughter, but also my duty as a Silvermane Guard.<br /><br />But\u00a0I'm aware of the risks I might face on this journey. So, if I fail to win my mother's approval\u2014or if something happens to me\u2014please forward this letter to the Landau siblings and ask for their help. Serval and Gepard are honorable people\u00a0with enormous power in Belobog, and I have complete faith in them. I'm sure they will unreservedly help you in your search for the Stellaron once they see my seal and handwriting.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Bronya Rand</align>",
