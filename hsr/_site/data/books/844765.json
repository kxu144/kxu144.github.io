Following which, all the workers in the Great Mine had a sumptuous meal. After that, the miners discovered more rock crab nests one after another while mining.<br /><br />This paper previously revealed that the Great Mine Administrative Committee a decided to provide salt-baked rock crabs for the workers' dinners for three consecutive weeks. A worker who wished to remain anonymous said: \"At least change it up a little! Why must it be the same thing every day?\" Concerning this, the Administrative Committee responded as follows: \"You are free to make your own food. If not, just sit quietly and eat your rock crabs in silence.\"<br /><br />In spite of the miners' intensifying protests against rock crabs, the sad irony is there would be no more such opportunity when they eventually come to miss the taste of rock crab in the future. The expansion of the rock crabs' nests could lead to the collapse of the mine. The supervisor and Administrative Committee of the Great Mine finally decided that, in order to ensure the safety of the mine, there needs to be continuous effort to completely eliminate hidden dangers. At present, all rock crab nests in Boulder Town's Great Mine have been destroyed.<br /><br />An accidental leak occurred in Boulder Town's Great Mine, the trapped miner, Peak, has been rescued<br /><br />On the morning of November <nobr>19</nobr>, a water leak accident occurred at Face <nobr>4707</nobr> in Boulder Town's Great Mine.

Finally, he was successfully rescued in <nobr>32</nobr> hours. As of the publication of this news, the miner's physical signs are normal, and he is in good mental state.<br /><br />According to the miner (Peak), he was in deep sleep when the accident occurred. This likely helped to preserve his mental health during the incident. The miner's actions seriously violated many regulations in the Miner's Safety Manual, but fortunately no one was seriously injured. The appropriate punishment and re-education will be implemented after he recovers.<br /><br />Rivet Town\u2013Fragmentum Monster Encounters Intensifies<br /><br />Encounters between Rivet Town and the Fragmentum monsters intensify. According to information from Wildfire, there is a trend of the monsters that have invaded Rivet Town leaving the town. Thanks to the traffic blockade on the main road, a small number of these mindless monsters left the town and were dealt with by Wildfire.<br /><br />Years ago, Rivet Town was completely overrun by monsters from the Fragmentum, and is now in a state of abandonment. All miners please stay away from this place as much as possible. Don't let greed tempt you to return for property and possessions. Please ensure that personal safety is a top priority.",

Steve immediately decided to fish for Rock Crabs with his fellow workers and delivered three large bags of Rock Crab caught to the Great Mine administrative office. The mine foreman informed all miners that they would be provided with free salt-baked Rock Crab for dinner for the next three days.<br />This prompted the mining team to celebrate in elation.\"Finally, a feast,\" exclaimed a worker who preferred not to be named.<br />The discussion on whether to destroy the Rock Crab nest is now at a fever pitch. Miner representatives who support destroying the nest expressed that if the Rock Crabs are allowed to roam free, they could pose a great safety hazard to the mine, while those who opposed refuted, saying it may be the only nest and it can provide a stable food source for the team.
