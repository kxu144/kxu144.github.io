Can you guess what I'm experiencing right now!?<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>04</nobr>:<nobr>26</nobr>:<nobr>01</nobr><br />The main star of the Abundance segmentum experienced a gravitational collapse due to an unknown influence. Soon after, there was a starquake!<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>04</nobr>:<nobr>26</nobr>:<nobr>22</nobr><br />Flashes in the universe and gamma afterglow fills everything in visible range.<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>04</nobr>:<nobr>26</nobr>:<nobr>58</nobr><br />This is such a rare sight. The team member that promised to come with me before got scared and ran away... *sigh* It'd be so nice if you were here.<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>04</nobr>:<nobr>27</nobr>:<nobr>39</nobr><br />So don't be mad, okay?<br /><br />Destination: Unknown light-years (exceeds detectable distance)<br />Sender: Herta Space Station, Rocky Martinez<br /><br /><align=\"center\">***Edits Below, Translation Sent***</align><br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>30</nobr>:<nobr>13</nobr><br />Got scared and ran away? Good.<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>30</nobr>:<nobr>13</nobr><br />From now on, don't accept any more gifts from that guy. It's obvious that he's unreliable.<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>37</nobr>:<nobr>02</nobr><br />I'm not mad... I'm actually regretting our little argument. You scared me to death when you said starquake. I thought something bad happened to you...<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>38</nobr>:<nobr>23</nobr><br />But now I know. The beauties of a starquake is a result of its dangers.<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>45</nobr>:<nobr>16</nobr><br />Let's go and watch it together next time. I will be right next to you even if it's dangerous.<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>56</nobr>:<nobr>05</nobr><br />What I mean is... If possible... From now on, I'd like to always stay by your side.<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>56</nobr>:<nobr>15</nobr><br />Do you understand what I'm trying to say?",
