I shouldn't have trusted her!<br /><br />\u2014 Update 2: Dear friends, I am rescinding my statement before. The Melon Fairy is not a divine being, because I did see her. She said she wanted to write my report for me! Hee-hee!<br /><br />(another person's handwriting): Just... stop. This is a hallucination caused by the hallucinogens from our department leaking into the fertilizer. Wake up! There will be no pretty Melon Fairy coming to help any of you complete your reports!",
