However, groups of people with the same misconceptions began to form into a larger group, bringing unexpected value. They progress from being familiar to having a common understanding, from harboring misconceptions to it becoming their faith. As more become attracted to a certain group, factions naturally form from within.<br /><br />Regardless of the size of factions, they all believe that their faith bears the will of the Aeons. Countless factions even claim to be the emissaries of a certain Aeon. Most of the Aeons have found no interest in the ways of these factions. Some, however, find it extremely amusing to watch these ants in their fervent labor. They may provide careful guidance, or create mysticism to alter the progress of the faction. This is their way of influencing the world.<br /><br />Though most of the Aeons remain distant, the vast number of factions have made the stars a lively place. They carry banners and flags, forming allies and foes, fighting those who stand against their beliefs. The galaxy became a lively place indeed.",

However, as the Cancer of All Worlds continues to spread, the star rails that the Express runs on also fell victim. The Express could barely run before the blight descended, and had no choice but to run around when the rails became overly obstructed.<br /><br />It remained so for many years until a girl with red hair discovered its existence. She was fascinated by the stories the engine and the star rails had in store. She spent countless hours repairing the cracks and evening the dents, restoring the Express to its original form. The curious girl then set foot into the Express and began her trailblazing voyage across the galaxy.<br /><br />The Astral Express made stops at every station, with passengers boarding and exiting along the way. Many join and leave the Express' journey. The travelers come from different worlds, shoulder different burdens, and heading to different destinations. However, while they are on the Astral Express, they would share the same voyage.

Using gravity as bowstring and stars as arrows, Lan shattered the Ambrosial Arbor and put the wickedness of the Abundance to an end.

The Aeon will never give you up, never let you down, or abandon you. They will never make you cry, say goodbye, or tell a lie and hurt you.\"<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Ast Rickley, super popstar of the Epsilon XII Galaxy</align></span><br /><br />The Masked Fools tell a parable of the birth of their beloved Aeon. When the Aeon of Elation climbed to the highest branch on the Tree of Existence, they saw the cold and despicable void, the stars operating like machinery, and how the meaning of all things bows before nothingness. They continued looking until they saw a baby fall to the ground and cry because it had been wronged. The Aeon burst into laughter, laughter so clear it tore through the cold universe and still reverberates through the universe today.<br /><br />The Fools believe that the truth of the world is a joke, and that the ultimate meaning of all things lies in mere laughter. The universe is merciless, but there is joy to eliminate pain, dilute sorrow, resist nothingness, and heal wounds. Laughter, the gift of intelligent races, is the only answer.<br /><br />Masked Fools are extremely radical when it comes to their belief amongst the followers of Elation. In their pursuit of pleasure, they do whatever it takes to find it, often causing havoc wherever they go. They laugh at heroes for self-righteousness, kings for lust for power, lovers for infatuation, and scholars for overthinking. Their goal is to stir the stagnant pool of life to create surges and change. It is only then that the Fools derive their greatest pleasure. It would be a welcome sight if someone could turn the tables on them.",

They often plunge into the sea of stars alone, traveling planet to planet with the sole purpose of fabricating, obscuring, and destroying the local history. History Fictionologists believe that the past determines the future \u2014 when a civilization's history is definite, its future development is doomed as all possibility is eliminated, leaving only a sad and rigid path forward. In order to save these worlds from the sad fate of objectivity, History Fictionologists, under the directive of Enigmata, are determined to shroud the universe in mystery.<br /><br />History Fictionologists carry out their mission of destroying history alone and decisively, with an altruism that is difficult to comprehend. Their views are poorly understood by most, and their blatant hatred of objective facts is somewhat extreme. Many worlds are beginning to realize the irreversible, intangible damage that these Emanators of Enigmata have caused to culture. Across the galaxy, History Fictionologists have a reputation comparable to that of the Antimatter Legion. The Intelligentsia Guild has publicly denounced them: The Antimatter Legion destroys matter, but the History Fictionologists destroy the very universe itself.",

They were once palace hall poets, chiaroscuro painters, masters of disguise, or occult monks. While having reached great heights in their respective fields, after coming into contact with the Aeons, they turned into an incomprehensible group of people who spouted ridiculousness and wrote falsehoods.<br /><br />Where the History Fictionologists are devoted to the mystification of history, The Riddlers are obsessed with destroying the certainty of language. Words used to express meaning are gradually obfuscated in the mouths of The Riddlers. They deconstruct texts, abuse metaphors, change word orders, tamper with semantics, and transform otherwise precise language into something beyond recognition.<br /><br />While The Riddlers are not as grandiose as History Fictionologists, their actions still have a subtle but huge impact on the universe. Why is it so hard to find a pure and precise language in the galaxy these days? That is another riddle left by The Riddlers.",
