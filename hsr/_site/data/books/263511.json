   "localDesc": "Dear Mr. Carefree:<br /><br />I never thought that you'd write me a letter after all these millennia! Thank you for your letter. I've read it over and over again. I'm speechless at your generosity!<br /><br />I'm afraid you may not know that the advisory letter you replied to was written by my grandfather. Back then, he was in a deep trouble and impatient, seeking advice from you on a way out \u2014 but he never got that reply. However, it is very gratifying that my grandfather went with the letter's choice of a \"familial payback plan to forge a way out together.\"<br /><br />Time flies, and nearly three millennia have passed since then. Even though grandpa had since fallen from being stricken with mara and had passed on to the next life in the Hall of Karma, we still follow his teachings \u2014 and we have finally repaid the debt in full. We have finally lived up to our family name.<br /><br />Grandpa used to always say: \"Money has its price, but sincerity is priceless. People have their limits, but trust is limitless.\" Despite grandpa's failing to receive your advice, if spirits really do exist, then he must be pleased as punch to know that you're in agreement with him!<br /><br />There's too much to say in such a hasty reply. Please take good care of yourself!",
