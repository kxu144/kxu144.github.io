   "localDesc": "1. There is a place in the city where if you continue walking forward, you will end up in the air.<br /><br />2. If you repeatedly rock back and forth at the corner of the street, the ground will open up and swallow you into the abyss.<br /><br />3. At a specific point in time, the people that pass by you will suddenly open their arms and make a T-pose.<br /><br />4. If you suddenly turn around at a crowded place, the walls will become white.<br /><br />5. If you utter a certain mysterious phrase, the person you're conversing with will turn into a monster.<br /><br />6. The heater and trash can on the side of the street become square boxes when it snows.<br /><br />7. When you're in a place with no one else around, music of an unknown origin could be heard.<br /><br />8. If you are reading this, all the miraculous things above will happen to you.",
