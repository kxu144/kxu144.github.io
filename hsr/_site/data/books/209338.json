   "localDesc": "Profile Number: <nobr>021</nobr><br />Curio Designation: Astro Rod<br />Remarks: Only as a collection item. Research application is forbidden.<br />Curio Profile: A tool invented by Herta researchers to explore the geological structure of alien planets. Mainly made of the <nobr>108</nobr>th elemental metal from a deceased planet. Its body emits a glowing blue radiance, appearing as if the user is holding nothing. The sensor at the end points to where the user came from and guides them on the way back. No matter how hard the geological structure of the planet is, just gently insert the Astro Rod into the surface of the planet, and it can analyze a great deal of geological data. It is a sacred object in the eyes of those researchers who are fascinated with the study of planetology.<br />Related Studies:<br />1.

I've heard of it even before stepping foot in the space station, and now I finally can see it in its physical form!<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Wen Shiling, Department of Implement Arts</align><br />An Astro Rod is said to be the gift that best represents someone's love. An Astro Rod can point her in the direction she desires, and can tell her my feelings for her...<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 [NAME OMITTED], Department of Galactic Geography</align><br />Don't think I don't know what you're up to!<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Bernard, Department of Galactic Geography</align><br /><br />Profile Number: <nobr>056</nobr><br />Curio Designation: Light of The Stars (Defunct)<br />Remarks: The Curio has been damaged during the invasion of Antimatter Legion. Do not submit research applications.<br />Curio Profile: A tiny, pristine, and well-decorated box. The container itself is clean and flawless, and it has nine mini drawers on each of its four faces (not including the top and the bottom faces). Within each drawer is a luminescent crystal that corresponds to a color on the starlight spectrum. Currently only contains parts of its original pieces as the Curio is yet to be fully restored.<br />Related Studies:<br />1.

Only two studies before it's my turn, and the Legion destroyed it!<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Emily, Department of Insight</align><br />Why does the Department of Insight like studying this thing so much?

Hold it to your ear to hear distant jokes told in the conch. As long as you can hold back from laughing, you can slowly obtain the power offered by the being within the conch. Those who try to gain power in this way will eventually die in a depression of unmatched intensity. Legend says three previous users are still alive and living in seclusion.<br />Related Studies:* Due to outdated research data, the Crackup Conch will be reconditioned in the near future. All related papers are currently disabled. Please stay tuned.<br /><br />Researcher Notes:<br />Thank you, magical conch. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know what to do when I feel down.<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Mare, Department of Insight</align><br />What is wrong with this thing? Why does it keep trash talking me? My blood pressure is through the roof. Just how is it de-stressing?<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Wen Shiqi, Department of Implement Arts</align><br />Let's just change its name and call it Crackup Conch (Corrupted). @Lead Researcher Asta, when will this be updated?<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Joanne, Medical Department</align>",

The imperial crown from the silicon-based lifeforms of the Totton planet, a living fossil of the monarchy's history. The life forms of this race have clear crystal bodies. They think and communicate through internally generated electrical signals. When a Tottonid dies, it becomes pure mineral. Illnesses in its body turn it brightly colored. Each deceased Tottonid emperor will be embedded in this crown of laurels composed of the remains of previous emperors. The Tottonids believe this crown brings the wisdom of generations to its rulers. It's also the reason why the rulers of the Tottonid have always been unusually large, heavy, and beautiful.<br />Related Studies:<br />1.

Use it on ordinary items and, with a \"beep\" sound, you will see that Pom-Pom is 1 point, Himeko 9 points, the lab's glass doors <nobr>10</nobr> points, and the cosmic bouquet 2 points. March 7th cannot be rated by this device. As for the internal reasoning behind its rating system, every researcher aboard the space station has their own theory, which could have been compiled into a whole book called Study on the Rating System of the Rating Pistol.<br />Related Studies:<br /><span style=\"display: inline-block; color: #eb4d3dff; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\">???, Department of ??? \u2014 I'll give it a go</span><br /><span style=\"display: inline-block; color: #eb4d3dff; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\">???, Department of ??? \u2014 New entry logged.

   "localDesc": "Profile Number: <nobr>1381</nobr><br />Curio Designation: Total Eclipse of the Heart<br />Remarks: Contain in vacuum. Do not activate.<br />Curio Profile: A conical device made by an unknown polished rock. When the central cones are perpendicular to each other, the device enters a dormant state. When the cones are parallel, the device is activated. When activated, any object that crosses the outer ring will be corroded and disintegrated into basic particles. The device is usually used to disintegrate waste products on the space station and transmute them into usable materials for the different departments. One thing to note is that once the number of objects disintegrated exceeds a certain point, the corrosion area will expand and will cause an observable negative reaction to the psyche of organic life forms. Do not activate without written permission from the space station.<br />Related Studies:<br />1.

The shape is consistent with the common toilet seat, with a ceramic-textured surface and a complete flushing system. The mechanism of action is unknown for the time being, and no significant side effects have been reported after the teleportation is completed. However, due to personal constitution, symptoms such as dizziness and vomiting may occur after repeated use in a short period of time. Rumors like \"Bury your head in a toilet and flush it, and you will open a door to a brand new world\" was once widely circulated on a certain planet, and the existence of this machine confirmed the authenticity of some of the rumors.<br />Related Studies:<br />(The \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 experiment using Door to A New World and its data are not available to the public for the time being according to the request of the Department of Implement Arts.)<br />Researcher Notes:<br />I've stuck my head in this thing, but why did I not end up in a \"new world\"?<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 [NAME OMITTED], Department of Galactic Geography</align><br />The researcher in the comment above, you don't seem very sharp. You shouldn't put your head inside. You should be sitting on it and flush!<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Adler, Department of Ecology</align><br /><br />Profile Number: <nobr>2691</nobr><br />Curio Designation: Energy Black Hole<br />Remarks: Do not expose to food items. Activate the heating mode of the space station's thermostat system before utilizing the Curio.<br />Curio Profile: A heater fueled by some kind of clean energy, it was once used as an electric pancake pan by an IPC trade commissioner (note: attempted). After being spotted by a Department of Implement Arts researcher, it was brought to the space station. The patterns on the surface of the heater was ascertained by the Department of Insight to be the crest of an anonymous family and the name of a person suspected of being \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Landau. The heating function of the heater is non-functional and non-responsive to any fuel inserted. According to the current observation record, the heater will actively absorb heat energy from surrounding objects, and excessive exposure to it can cause hypothermic reactions to homeothermic animals.<br />P.S. A joint experiment from the Departments of Implement Arts and Service has shown that the energy that the heater can absorb does not, in fact, include caloric energy from food items.<br />Related Studies:<br />1.

Adler, Department of Implement Arts Lv. 2 Researcher \u2014 A New Perspective on Population Growth and Explosion: Organic Populations and Black Holes<br />Researcher Notes:<br />What? Not for heating food? So what can this be used for? This touches on the blind spot in my cognition!<br /><align=\"right\">\u2014 Mare, Department of Insight</align><br />Nonsense conclusion! That experiment was not rigorous at all, and the \"zero calorie\" decision was unnecessarily stringent! Look, as long as it was not listed on the package itself, the food inside would come up to zero calories!
