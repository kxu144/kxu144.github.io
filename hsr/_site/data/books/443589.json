Even though I achieved unfavorable results in the last evaluation, after some reflection, I believe the root cause lies in the unpredictability of Wubbaboo as a subject of research. After the Protection Net topic was handed over to me, I have submitted a new research report to my supervisor and am hopeful for a reversal for my evaluation score.<br /><br />*1. The weighted average of multiple assessments is adopted for the evaluation score.<br />*2.
