There's a glimmer in his eyes, and I'm always sort of in a trance when looking at him.\" On the press night of Stardust Rose, Julie revealed to the reporters present an interesting story during the rehearsal of Stardust Rose.<br /><br />Julie and Iain both won the Goliards Award for Best Actor and Actress with their performance in Theater Story last year. A month after winning the award, the two received an invitation from Amy, the playwright of Stardust Rose. Despite this stage couple of the drama world having already worked together many times before, Julie said with a smile that she still couldn't resist the unique charm of her old colleague.<br /><br />Stardust Rose is co-directed by two Goliards Award winners for Best Direction of a Play, and is romance novelist Amy's first stage play. Iain felt it was a little different from the typical romances, not just because it was co-directed by two well-known directors, but also because \"I felt amazing chemistry with Julie during rehearsals.\"<br /><br />Iain tells us that during one rehearsal, Julie's skirt got tangled in a nearby prop. But because of the strong rapport between them \u2014 thanks to their countless past collaborations \u2014 Iain immediately caught Julie, and within the short duration of the changing backdrops, was able to help untangle her skirt.<br /><br />Julie revealed that in this sudden incident, Ian catching her was considered by director Jeffrey to be a \"stroke of genius,\" which happened to perfectly fit the scene of the botanist played by Julie being trapped: \"Alice is a botanist who is completely immersed into her career as a researcher. She is a little out of touch with the rest of society, so she doesn't know how to call for help, even when she's in a tight spot.\" \"But Howard's actions come from the heart.\" Taking this into consideration, Iain told us that because of this incident, this stage direction was written into the official script.<br /><br />\"Throughout the rehearsals of Stardust Rose, we were infected with a wonderful atmosphere. While we had to perform in front of many people, as the plot developed toward the end, I think we must have entered a kind of blissful detachment, it felt really magical.\" Julie believes that Stardust Rose has a unique romantic atmosphere, different from all the plays she had acted in before. \"It's like being infected by love,\" Iain added.",
