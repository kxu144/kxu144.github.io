The tube is filled with dark gold gel, which absorbs all known colors and turns into that specific shade in the end.<br /><br />This is a commonly seen emergency item the Nameless carries. Whether in the void of the galaxy or on the ocean of a planet, the Colored Beacon Paste will always release a line of brilliant colors on the galactic darkness or on an ocean. It will also adjust its own color contrast and saturation based on the light source and shade of its surroundings.<br /><br />The bright, visually stimulating colors of the Colored Beacon Paste allow the Galactic Rescue to easily spot signs written with it. It was invented by a Nameless who possessed great artistic abilities. This Nameless once experienced a flight incident and was trapped in a barren and desolate star system. In the end, with the use of scraps from a White Star fragment, he was able to produce the most magnificent item in the history of search and rescue \u2014 the Colored Beacon Paste.<br /><br />There are also galactic bandits who use the Colored Beacon Paste to leave graffiti packed with profanity everywhere in the universe out of ill intentions, a rebellious nature, or an inflated ego.<br /><br /><align=\"center\">P<nobr>17071</nobr></align>",
