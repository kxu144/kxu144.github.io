Here Are the Three Unmissable Moments in the Show</align><br /><align=\"right\">Author: Olsen, Journalist of Belobog Weekly</align><br /><br />With a dazzling cast never before seen, the Golden Theater recently drew up the curtains for the powerful thirty-year commemorative performance for Beneath the White Cloak! Apparently, the number of citizens queuing up for tickets had repeatedly blocked key roads in the Administrative District, ultimately getting the Silvermane Guards to come out to maintain order.<br /><br />The suspense musical Beneath the White Cloak, famous throughout Belobog, is the longest running show in the history of the Golden Theater. As we anticipate the thirty-year commemorative performance, we review the three unmissable famous scenes in the history of this show.<br /><br />1. The mysterious white silk and crystal petals that fall from box number five<br />When the Lady in White first appears, a very mysterious and delicate white silk will fall from on top of box number five. Hand-made crystal petals will also fall with the silk. In previous and popular versions of the show, the silk usually falls at a speed of <nobr>2.5</nobr> meters per second. The hand-made flower petals are specifically dyed to reflect marvelous colors under the light. Importantly, out of all the official merchandise sold in the theater for Beneath the White Cloak, the crystal petals are the most popular \u2014 The cast also do not prohibit the audience from taking the petals with them. For over thirty years, this had been the unspoken agreement between the audience and the production cast. In fact, the thirty-year commemorative production had declared they had more than six thousand crystal petals prepared for every performance.<br /><br />2. Count David's Proposal: The Omnipresent Lady in White<br />When Count David publicly proposes to Lareina, the most fascinating part is not the seemingly romantic love story between the lead characters, but the unpredictable re-appearance of the Lady in White. In the initial version of the performance, the Lady in White suddenly appeared in the audience. As the Golden Theater became more technically advanced, the Lady in White's re-appearance became more mysterious and epic. She could walk out from the reflections of countless mirrors on the stage, and could also rise slowly from beneath the floor boards under the candelabra in the middle of the audience after a loud bang and copious amounts of fog. The technical department of the Theater designed a set that can only be moved with twenty people in order to create the mystery of the Lady in White. This had satisfied the audience for the past decade, and also gave rise to a minigame popular amongst theater-goers \u2014 can YOU guess where the Lady in White is going to appear during a particular performance?<br /><br />3. An all-star finale sang by established and upcoming actors<br />The final chorus is the closing act for all actors in the theater within the show. The protagonist Lareina is only an upcoming character, while Rebecca stands in the audience and they gaze at each other. In the story, the protagonist silently leaves the stage as the leading actors sing together. However, Beneath the White Cloak had influenced generations of musical talent in the past thirty years. At the end of the story, the final song \"Sleepless Night\" was just meant to be a collective performance, but the wide appeal of the show gradually became the collective memory of generations. Nowadays, the \"temporary actors\" appearing on stage at the final song are usually very established actors, or even past leads in older renditions of Beneath the White Cloak. Various famous actors in the musical scene would also make sudden appearances in this ending show. For the audience, this is an absolutely must-see moment, a sparkling scene that will get you your money's worth \u2014 who can say no to the joy of trying to count how many famous actors are on the stage at the end?",
