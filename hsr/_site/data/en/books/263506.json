Only a fighter like you can handle such an important task.<br />Yesterday, a disciple absconded in disgrace. She posted a letter as she defected.<br />Based on our investigation, it's an urgent missive to the Seat of Divine Foresight.<br />It shouldn't have arrived yet. Intercept it, and help us mitigate our losses.<br />Once you finish this arduous yet glorious task, I will introduce you to the Exalting Sanctum's leader of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.<br />So long as he assents, you can begin your journey on the way of immortality.<br /><align=\"right\">Green Hibiscus</align>",
