We have had a very enjoyable collaboration in the past. The book, which is scheduled to be published in the <nobr>2160</nobr> AE, is a retelling of everything I've learned since studying the Masked Fools in the form of an anti-chivalric novel, and is a true account of the third turning point in my life.<br /><br />In addition, I will be conducting a mysterious experiment inside the space station. Lead Researcher Asta has already agreed to my request. I'll try not to bother anyone \u2014 it's just a tiny adjunct that came with my third change-of-heart, in order to fulfill a small wish of mine.<br /><br />*1.
