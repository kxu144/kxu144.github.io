You must have recognized it. Yes, there's lord Herta's handwriting as well. Surprise, eh?<br />If you are a junior who worries all day to impress your boss, take a deep breath! No good if you have a heart attack now.<br />If you are one of those playful young fellows, I'd suggest you take them, go back to them when you find life miserable and have a good laugh when you are not busy doing your research in a dark corner of the tower.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Laughing Hosea Lazaro</align>",

That means you always follow through with what you started.<br />I have to admit, it would hurt my reputation had I asked you to go through so much trouble just for nothing.<br />After all, I can't foresee to whom this letter will go so many Amber Eras later.<br />There is a chance, however unlikely it may be, that you are a future defender of my reputation, someone worthy of my legacy.<br />Wouldn't want to accidentally put you under friendly fire, would I?<br />Hm, so be it. It's time that I bring forward the real treasure.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Your Respected Hosea Lazaro</align>",
