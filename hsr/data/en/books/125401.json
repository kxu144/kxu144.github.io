Repairs are done automatically by the system. Feedback unnecessary.<br />Record <nobr>000238</nobr>: Anomalous wave bands detected on radar scans along patrol route <nobr>18</nobr>, subsistence zone. Handed over to Security Department.<br />Record <nobr>000238</nobr> Feedback: Security Department confirmed that the wave band is normal and determined the irregularity is due to Curio experimentation.<br />Record <nobr>000241</nobr>: Base zone \u2014 Security and protection balance chamber \u2014 Irregular ventilator operation with airflow speed reaching <nobr>140%</nobr> of the preset value.

It blows excessively in front of regular staff members and the air became soft again in front of the others!</span><br />Record <nobr>000243</nobr>: Anomalous wave band detected on radar scans along patrol route <nobr>42</nobr>, base zone. Handed over to Security Department.<br /><span style=\"display: inline-block; color: #dbc291ff; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\">Abraham: Catastrophe. It's the start of the catastrophe. Number <nobr>42</nobr> is synonymous with disasters. If we had turned on the repulsion bridge back then, would we have lost so many lives? Wait, what am I doing? Am I hypothesizing or am I dreaming?</span><br />Record <nobr>000244</nobr>: Anomalous wave band detected on radar scans along patrol route <nobr>19</nobr>, storage zone. Handed over to Security Department.<br />Record <nobr>000245</nobr>: Anomalous wave band detected on radar scans along patrol route 2, storage zone. Handed over to Security Department.

All staff members are urged to seek shelter.<br /><span style=\"display: inline-block; color: #dbc291ff; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\">Abraham: The coordination of the lead researcher is outstanding. She is really trying to control the negative effects this disaster is having on us. However, I sometimes fantasize that I was one of those who were unable to get to safety. I might have died under the trampling footsteps of those beasts. If that had happened, would anyone remember me?</span><br />...<br />Record <nobr>135298</nobr>: Base zone \u2014 Experimentation room <nobr>72</nobr> exterior.

Each ticking of the Obstacle Detection Terminal signifies the end of several lives. Maybe the next one is me?
