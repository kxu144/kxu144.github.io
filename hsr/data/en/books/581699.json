   "localDesc": "<align=\"center\">Written by Gunn Konolev</align><br /><br />Several significant things contributed to my unwavering motivation as a researcher in the early years of my career: my inherent curiosity, my\u00a0view of justice untainted by reality, and the agony of being powerless in the face of the loss of my youth and my motherland.<br /><br />Because of these conflicting emotions, I've written lots of books about galactic justice, planetary history, and malevolent factions. In my works, I investigated the order of chaos and the future of the universe, and I once thought the past, present, and future of the galaxy were already within my grasp, until... that incident happened and revealed that I was only a researcher after all. When reality hit, I couldn't stop the powerful from destroying people's lives, nor could I save the helpless people who were dying.<br /><br />As a result, in the final years of my career, I ceased investigating justice. For people without power, justice is an overly lofty concept. <span style=\"display: inline-block; color: #eb4d3dff; text-align:center; font-weight:bold;\"><b>I intend to undertake a secret experiment inside the space station at the end of my life.</b></span> Lead Researcher Asta has agreed to my request.<br /><br />I'll try not to bother anyone with this experiment \u2014 I realize it's an unreasonable request, so here's my confession\u2014this experiment is only a minor substitute for my abandonment of justice, just to fulfill a small wish of mine.",
