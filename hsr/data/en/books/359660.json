I hail from this legendary workshop!</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Rivet Town has completely fallen to the invasion of Fragmentum Monsters, and the old Tempering Workshop has disbanded because of that.</align><br /><align=\"center\">Even as I arrive at this vagrant camp, I am unable to locate my former colleagues.</align><br /><align=\"center\">However, there are a number of able craftspeople among the vagrant community, and we have hit it off right away.</align><br /><align=\"center\">Therefore, I have decided to inherit the name of the beloved Tempering Workshop by founding the</align><br /><align=\"center\">New Tempering Workshop!</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Services provided:</align><br /><align=\"center\">Appraisal, repairing, and recycling of various ancient relics</align><br /><align=\"center\">Recycling and refurbishment of old parts</align><br /><align=\"center\">Sale of various spare parts</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">We hope all fellow vagrants pay attention to the fact that the supply of goods in the workshop does not come from conventional channels.</align><br /><align=\"center\">All of the parts we have are sourced from putting in hard work and risking our lives in the machine graveyard. </align><br /><align=\"center\">Each and every one of them has a soul and is infused with our heart and persistence!</align><br /><align=\"center\">Even though some may complain about the appearance and variety of our wares,</align><br /><align=\"center\">You will be hard-pressed to find another establishment like ours!</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">So what are you waiting for?</align><br /><align=\"center\">Take action rather than take fancy!</align><br /><align=\"center\">Come to the New Tempering Workshop and look for the gadgets of your dreams!</align><br /><align=\"center\">Come with your robot friend and enjoy a <nobr>50%</nobr> discount!</align>",
