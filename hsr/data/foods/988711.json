The only threat this fragile little planet was facing was the merciless war with the Antimatter Legion. The Mourning Actors were not aware of the Architects. The only sight they witnessed was the trail of destruction left by the Legion. They rowed their gondolas quietly above the planet and left before the Legion could notice them, leaving behind a silent eulogy.<br />Time flew by and the Belobog Architects found a type of beautiful stone that glimmered with bright colors. They mixed the stone with Geomarrow and built a monument, which some say still stands at the heart of Qlipoth Fort in the city of Belobog.<br /><br />\"Even if we fail, this monument will stand for all eternity. Those who come after will find it and know that we had once existed.\"",

The ghosts of the past condensed into clouds and rained down crystals like teardrops.
