(This time I'm going to hide in the harbor. But I can't hide for long. I'm running out of hiding places.)<br /><br />Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and wardens of the Ten-Lords Commission are all here, and I can't be found by either of them. In order not to be discovered by them, I left. I guess that the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus are trying their utmost to capture you and me in order to prevent the secret from being leaked, and the wardens seem to have received intel on the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and are looking for them at the Cloudford.<br /><br />If I weren't an Elixir Seeker, I would have come out and applauded the Ten-Lords Commission.<br /><br />Come find me as soon as possible. I can't wait to see you.<br /><br />As before, I will be in my next hiding place. Call out for me when you arrive. After confirming that you are alone by yourself, I will come out. Remember, come alone, I won't reveal myself if other people are present.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Liangmu</align>",
