   "localDesc": "<align=\"center\">*A shabby handwritten flyer. You can feel the writer's effort as the paper has been penetrated at several characters, but you can still read it.*</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Boulder Town residents</align><br /><align=\"center\">When you receive this flyer,</align><br /><align=\"center\">you should know that the fissure is now corroding our home. </align><br /><align=\"center\">In the past, we had Silvermane Guards repelling invading monsters at the front line.</align><br /><align=\"center\">However, with an order, the soldiers have been sent away to the distant battle field.</align><br /><align=\"center\">They never come back.</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Without protection from the Silvermane Guards, we saw the tragedy of the Rivet Town.</align><br /><align=\"center\">Some escaped to the Boulder Town, struggling for a new life.</align><br /><align=\"center\">Some went into the mines, living a homeless life.</align><br /><align=\"center\">But are those misfortunes fated?</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Of course not!</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Pick up your pickaxes, take your explosions.</align><br /><align=\"center\">We know that the fissure's corrosion never stops. We know that monsters are running towards us.</align><br /><align=\"center\">Stop daydreaming about when the Silvermane Guards would return. We can protect ourselves!</align><br /><align=\"center\">This our belief, Wildfire's belief.</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Wildfire not only want warriors.</align><br /><align=\"center\">We want more people to stand together and maintain the city's order from collapsing.</align><br /><align=\"center\">We also need more people to contribute to scientific medical aids.</align><br /><align=\"center\">We also want more people to discuss the future of the Underworld.</align><br /><align=\"center\">We look forward to your participation.</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Join Us</align><br /><align=\"center\">You can ask any Wildfire member you see in the Underworld about how to join us.</align><br /><br /><align=\"center\">Gathering Spot</align><br /><align=\"center\">Boulder Town, behind the Gathering Place (Turn right when you arrive at the barrel decoration on the top, then go straight.)</align>",
