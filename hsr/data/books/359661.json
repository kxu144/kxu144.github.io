   "localDesc": "You, don't move.<br />When you find this note, you've already entered the surveillance zone of my Sky-Eye system.<br />In other words, your exploration operation, which you thought went undetected, has been noted down by me.<br />I've gone through the trouble of triple-encrypting this chamber just to lock the boring past within it.<br />I can't just let you go now that you've discovered the big secret about my lineage.<br />You inhaled the hallucinogenic poisonous gas as soon as you entered the room.<br />The gas is so deadly that even the space station's greatest doctors are powerless to save you...<br />In a nutshell, you're dead!<br /><br />Ha! Is this joke making you shiver? You shouldn't have just barged into someone's private property.<br />Okay, okay, there is no \"Sky-Eye\" or deadly gas.<br />This room, on the other hand, is loaded with ancient and rare artifacts, none of which I want.<br />You can take whatever you want as a reward for breaking the triple encryption.<br />That's right, I prefer to reward rather than punish when it comes to running the space station\u2014<br />Encouraging you in your adventures and pursuit of knowledge.<br />Thank me!<br /><br />Don't forget to put away the things you messed up, get the reward you want, and leave.<br />Don't hang around, and don't be greedy. Otherwise, I'm not sure what I'd do if I became angry.<br /><br /><align=\"right\">Your dearest dearest dearest</align><br /><align=\"right\">The Prophetic Lead Researcher Asta</align><br /><align=\"right\">Muah</align>",
