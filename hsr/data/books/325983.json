After cleaning it and taking it home, remember to put it with mothproof incense wood.<br /><br />Ms. Luhui has a lot of clothes that she will never wear again but is reluctant to throw away. Those clothes need to be packed and stored in boxes.<br /><br />Don't throw away something she won't wear in front of her face, or she'll get upset.",
