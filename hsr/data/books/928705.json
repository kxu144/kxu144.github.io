I looked through some ancient text today and found a method for it. I've been eager to share it with you.<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>18</nobr>:<nobr>12</nobr>:<nobr>24</nobr><br />\"Place the rod in the soil, straight and direct. Straight as in not crooked, and straight as in not bent. Hold the rod with both hands, and pierce it straight into the dirt. Inspect the straightness, use the mirror to focus the light. If the light reaches the bottom, then you're all set. If the light lands on the wall of the hole, then it is bent.\"<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>19</nobr>:<nobr>40</nobr>:<nobr>11</nobr><br />Memorize it and tell me if it works.<br /><br />Source: Unknown light-years (exceeds detectable distance)<br />Recipient: Herta Space Station, Rocky Martinez<br /><br /><align=\"center\">***Translated Text Below***</align><br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>02</nobr>:<nobr>55</nobr>:<nobr>08</nobr><br />Ahh, silly Rocky, Astro Rods are so outdated nowadays! Hasn't the one you guys have at your school also been sitting in the collections cabinet?<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>02</nobr>:<nobr>56</nobr>:<nobr>43</nobr><br />All the tools the research team now uses to measure planetary soil are from the IPC.<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>02</nobr>:<nobr>58</nobr>:<nobr>20</nobr><br />Well, seeing that it's the Astro Rod that you gave me, I suppose I'll try and figure out how it works. I believe that digging up some precious rare-earth elements with it shouldn't be a problem.<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>03</nobr>:<nobr>02</nobr>:<nobr>34</nobr><br />Hey, aren't you always doing research with rocks? What's your favorite colored mineral? I'll try to look for it.",
