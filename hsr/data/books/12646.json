The air here is so refreshing!<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>06</nobr>:<nobr>33</nobr>:<nobr>08</nobr><br />Even though this place isn't actual Aeons territory, it's already able to generate an extremely high degree of oxygen just by being close to the Aeons.<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>06</nobr>:<nobr>33</nobr>:<nobr>29</nobr><br />This is my first time witnessing Theophany... I've always stayed inside the space station. Only reading about this is like living under a rock.<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>06</nobr>:<nobr>33</nobr>:<nobr>39</nobr><br />Ah, the repeater signal is about to end... I feel like I said a lot of meaningless things. Sorry.<br /><br />Lesley Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>06</nobr>:<nobr>34</nobr>:<nobr>48</nobr><br />Don't forget to keep up the good work at the space station. Try your best to come out to see the stars soon, just like that Hosea who you admire so much.<br /><br />Destination: Unknown light-years (exceeds detectable distance)<br />Sender: Herta Space Station, Rocky Martinez<br /><br /><align=\"center\">***Edits Below, Translation Sent***</align><br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>14</nobr>:<nobr>18</nobr><br />Lesley, congratulations on your safe arrival!<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>25</nobr>:<nobr>27</nobr><br />Don't worry, I scored Excellent in the previous evaluation and I'll definitely do it again next time.<br /><br />Rocky Herta Space Station System Time <nobr>08</nobr>:<nobr>41</nobr>:<nobr>43</nobr><br />Lesley, what you said was very interesting. It's definitely not a waste of time! Tell me about everything you see. I'll be waiting to hear from you!",
